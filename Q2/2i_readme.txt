This code can perform various word-count-related operations on files.
Here's a brief description of what the code does:

1. The program starts by reading user input, which includes commands, options, and filenames.

2. The `countWords` function counts the number of words in a given sentence, considering whitespace characters
as separators.

3. Depending on the user's input, the program executes different functionalities:
   - **word -n filename**: This mode calculates the number of words in the specified file and prints the result.
   - **word -d file1 file2**: This mode calculates the difference in word count between two files and displays
    the absolute difference.

4. The program uses file handling functions to open and read files.
   - `wordcount` counts the words in a given file.
   - `differenceBetweenFilesWords` calculates the difference in word count between two files.

5. The program uses `fgets` to process user input and remove the newline character.
   
6. The program utilizes various string manipulation functions, such as `strncpy` and `sscanf`, to extract 
relevant information from the user's input.

7. The program makes use of conditional statements to handle different modes of operation.

8. It uses the `strrchr` function to locate the last occurrence of a space character and extract the filename
 from the input.

9. The code also includes some error handling, like checking if files are empty or if they failed to open.

Overall, the code demonstrates basic file handling, string manipulation, and conditional branching to create
a utility that performs word count-related operations on files based on user input. It handles different 
scenarios like counting words in a file and comparing word counts between two files.
