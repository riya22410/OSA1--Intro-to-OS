This code demonstrates a program that uses the `fork` function to create a child process, where the parent process generates the 
Fibonacci series up to 16, and the child process calculates the factorial of 4. Here's a brief description of the code:

1. The program includes necessary header files: `stdio.h`, `sys/types.h`, `unistd.h`, and `sys/wait.h`.

2. The `factorial` function calculates the factorial of a given integer `n` recursively.

3. The `main` function starts by initializing variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, and a variable `current_status` to store the status of the child 
process.

4. The code uses the `fork` function to create a child process. If the `fork` call fails (returns a negative value), an error message is 
printed, and the program exits with an error status.

5. Inside the child process (when `rc` is 0), the factorial of 4 is calculated using the `factorial` function, and the result is printed. 
The child process then returns 0 to indicate successful completion.

6. In the parent process (when `rc` is positive and represents the child's PID), the program generates and prints the Fibonacci series up 
to 16. The Fibonacci series is generated using the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`.

7. After printing the Fibonacci series, the parent process uses the `wait` function to wait for any child process to finish executing. 
This ensures that this time, the parent's output gets printed before the child's output.

8. The program returns 0 to indicate successful completion.
