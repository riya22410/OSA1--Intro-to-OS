This C code demonstrates a program that uses the `vfork` function to create a child process, where the child process calculates the factorial
of 4, and the parent process generates the Fibonacci series up to 16. Here's a brief description of the code:

1. The program includes necessary header files: `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `sys/types.h`, `unistd.h`, and `sys/wait.h`.

2. The `factorial` function calculates the factorial of a given integer `n` recursively.

3. The `main` function starts by initializing variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, and a variable `current_status` to store the status of the child 
process.

4. The code uses the `vfork` function to create a child process. If the `vfork` call fails (returns a negative value), an error message is 
printed, and the program exits with an error status.

5. Inside the child process (when `rc` is 0), the factorial of 4 is calculated using the `factorial` function, and the result is printed.

6. In the parent process (when `rc` is positive), the program generates and prints the Fibonacci series up to 16. The Fibonacci series is
generated using the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`.

7. After printing the Fibonacci series, the parent process uses the `waitpid` function to wait for the child process to finish executing. 
This ensures that the parent process does not complete until the child process has finished its task.

8. The program returns 0 to indicate successful completion.
